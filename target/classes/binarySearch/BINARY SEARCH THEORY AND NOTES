In this package we are doing Binary search and related problems.
Whats is Binary Search - find mid element->compares the target with mid->eliminate the half where target can't lie->
takes again the mid of half in which element can lie->compare the element with target and repeat the process.

** NOTES TO NOTE ***
1.) Data Structure - Array
2.) Can performed on Sorted Array

** Performance (time complexity) and memory (space complexity)
1.) WORST CASE PERFORMANCE (WORST TIME COMPLEXITY) :- O(log n)
2.) BEST CASE PERFORMANCE (BEST TIME COMPLEXITY) :- O(1)
3.) Average Performance - O(log n)

4.) Worst case space complexity - O(1)
